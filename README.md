#####   > A BRNN based LSTM that generates piano keys and notes from a given midi file trained on a RTX 2080 Super.

#####   1)Client: 
        The Client side part with UI prepared from html,css and js(jQeury)
#####   2)Server: 
        The Server made from Flask(python) creating a REST API from the Neural Net that requests and responses GET and POST to the Client Side
#####   3)Model: 
        A Bi directional LSTM created from keras with tensorflow as the backend, with over 3,616,008 parameters

### The project is about 80% complete , with a lot to add always :)
